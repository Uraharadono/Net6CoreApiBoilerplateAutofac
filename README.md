# Net 6 Core Api - Boilerplate with Autofac DI


## What ?

A .Net 6 API project (I won't upgrade to .Net 7 cause my title is too specific :( ), which includes:

- Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity that is managing users and is using JSON Web Token (JWT) for auth. It is based on Identity Server, and you can easily change it to use Identity Server instead (see AuthenticationHelper.cs line 57).
- We'll use Autofac to register our Dependency Injection code. I prefer to use the built in Microsoft one, but I did it with Autofac just for exercise.
- I implemented a unit-of-work pattern that meets my needs and the needs of the projects I am working on quite well. Keep in mind that this version was written to support the running of stored procedures as well as to run queries in transactions.
- Added usage of sequences as primary key for table. (See the 2nd point in "Why?" below. )
- Modular Cors registration
- NLog library to do the logging (mainly exceptions for now) and saves them in the .txt files per day.Â 


## Why ?

For my and possibly your prototyping. Also, there is an ease of mind when there is a take home assignment to be done, so I can get quickly to the core of the problem without rushing to setup everything and wasting precious time.

The second reason is that I recently had an issue with supporting an old system that has a database with 500 tables that don't have Identity set as PK. I had to use SQL Sequences to achieve this (https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/26480), and I think there is really a huge gap with supporting things that do not fit the "newest and greatest" narrative.
Sometimes you just have to support legacy, and that's it.

## Before running the project

Nothing. Optionally, you can create a database called BloggingDb on your preferred database server (in my case, localhost).

## Run the project


1. Open npm console (Visual studio: View -> Other windows -> Package Manager Console)
2. Type command: Update-Database to EF Core run migrations
3. Run the api project


# Note for 401

If you get a 401 Status Code, it means you are not authorized. You can either remove the [Authorize] attribute on the controller or login and add the bearer token to the top of the page with Swagger.


# Plans for future? 

I think it would be good to add some example code for the EF Interceptors and EF Global filters.
